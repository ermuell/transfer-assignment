# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add .`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with ´git commit -m "commit-message"´
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout hash-or-branch-name`
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b branch-name`
7. To collaborate, first `git pull` others changes, then `git push` yours
